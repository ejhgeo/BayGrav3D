% coord_trans.m
% -------------
% Rotates data coordinates so that the gravity grid is aligned with x and
% y axes (i.e. with due N and E axis) and hence with the axes of the 
% ensuing model domain, using two reference points. This ensures that the 
% model domain is entirely covered by the gravity grid and aligned in a 
% cartesian geometry. Depending on your data, this step is optional and 
% should be applied only in the pre- and post-processing. 

% *** All data, including both gravity and priors, need to be projected and
% rotated by the same amount so that everything is in the same reference
% coordinate system ***
%
% INPUT: 
%   data: x,y,[g,z,etc.]: array to be rotated
%   refpoints: x,y: arrray of at least 2 points forming a line parallel to 
%                   an edge of the grid
%   rot: 'ccw' or 'cw': direction in which to rotate the coordinates, 
%                       counterclockwise or clockwise
%
% OUTPUT:
%   newdata: x,y,[g,z,etc.] array of the data in the rotated coordinates
% ======================================================================= %
