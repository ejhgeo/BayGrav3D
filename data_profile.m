% data_profile.m
% --------------
% Samples a 2D grid (i.e. gravity) along a given transect and outputs a
% profile along that transect.
%
% INPUT:
%   X:    X coordinates of grid to sample, a 2D grid
%   Y:    Y coordinates of grid to sample, a 2D grid
%   grid: grid to sample (i.e. gravity), a 2D grid
%   slice_position: position (in distance) where the profile intersects the
%                   chosen axis, a scalar
%   slice_orientation: 'x' or 'y', orienation of the resulting profile, 'x' 
%                                  being parallel to the x axis (E-W
%                                  profile) and 'y' being parallel to the y
%                                  axis (N-S profile)
%
% OUPUT:
%   profile_axis: distance along the profile, a vector
%   profile:      data [i.e. gravity] values along the profile, a vector
% ======================================================================= %
