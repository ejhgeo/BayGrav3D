% tikhonov_reg.m
% --------------
% Constructs the complete tikhonov regularization matrix used to stabilize
% the gravity inversion. Computes the finite difference approximation to
% the first or second derivative of the model parameters, based on the grid
% geometry, for each direction (x, y, z) separately. Also constructs the
% first order boundary condition regularization matrices applied only to
% the edge parameters. The final output L matrix is a linear combination of
% all the uni-directional and boundary L matrices. 
%
% INPUT:
%   num_param: total number of model parameters
%   Reg:       regularization type, one of the following:
%              0:   Zeroth Order
%              111: 1st order regularization in all directions
%              222: 2nd order regularization in all directions
%              221: 2nd order regularization in horz; 1st order in vertical
%
%   x_c:       x-coordinates of prism centroids
%   y_c:       y-coordinates of prism centroids
%   z_c:       z-coordinates of prism centroids
%
%   a:         Tikhonov regularization weight in the x-direction
%   b:         Tikhonov regularization weight in the y-direction
%   c:         Tikhonov regularization weight in the z-direction
%   A:         Boundary condition regularization weight in the x-direction
%   B:         Boundary condition regularization weight in the y-direction
%              Boundary condition weight must be very large: => 1e8
% OUTPUT:
%   L:         M x M regularization matrix used in gravity inversion
