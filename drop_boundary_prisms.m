% drop_boundary_prisms.m
% ----------------------
% Drops the boundary prisms from the x and y dimensions of the 3D
% subsurface mesh for plotting purposes. Should be called at the beginning
% of a plotting script if desired. 
%
% * This has a lot of input/output and it's a bit hard coded, but I only
% use it for plotting, so that you don't have to plot the boundary prisms.
% *** Modify as needed to suit your model's needs. 
%
% INPUT:
%   model:      posterior_model array saved from grav_inversion.m
%   layers:     the cell array of layers saved from the prior construction
%   layer_mean: mean that was substracted from each prism centroid, vector
%               of equivalent length to m, the model parameters
%   x:   nodal x coordinates of the mesh to modify
%   x_c: centroid x coordinates of the mesh to modify
%   y:   nodal y coordinates of the mesh to modify
%   y_c: centroid y coordinates of the mesh to modify
%
% OUTPUT:
%   Input variables to the function but with values on the boundary prisms 
%   dropped.
%   All mesh variables, as saved from grav_inversion.m, but with values on
%   the boundary prisms dropped.
